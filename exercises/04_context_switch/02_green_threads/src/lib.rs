//! # Green Thread Scheduler (riscv64)
//!
//! In this exercise, you build a simple cooperative (green) thread scheduler on top of context switching.
//! This crate is **riscv64 only**; run with the repo's normal flow (`./check.sh` / `oscamp`) or natively on riscv64.
//!
//! ## Key Concepts
//! - Cooperative vs preemptive scheduling
//! - Thread state: `Ready`, `Running`, `Finished`
//! - `yield_now()`: current thread voluntarily gives up the CPU
//! - Scheduler loop: pick next ready thread and switch to it
//!
//! ## Design
//! Each green thread has its own stack and `TaskContext`. Threads call `yield_now()` to yield.
//! The scheduler round-robins among ready threads. User entry is wrapped by `thread_wrapper`, which
//! calls the entry then marks the thread `Finished` and switches back.
